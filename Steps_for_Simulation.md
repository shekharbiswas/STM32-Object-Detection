# Steps for Simulation in STM32CubeIDE

## Setup STM32CubeIDE:

- Download and install STM32CubeIDE from the STMicroelectronics website.
- Create a new STM32 project using STM32CubeMX within STM32CubeIDE to configure the peripherals and generate initialization code.

## Integrate TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers:

- Clone the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers repository from GitHub.
- Include TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers source files and headers in your STM32CubeIDE project.
- Follow the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers Getting Started Guide to understand how to integrate and use the library.

## Prepare the TFLite Model:

- Convert your TensorFlow model to a TensorFlow Lite model if you havenâ€™t done so already.
- Use the TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers conversion tool to convert your model to a format optimized for microcontrollers.
- Save the model as a .cc file (e.g., model_data.cc) which includes the TFLite model in a C array format.

## Write the Main Application Code:

In your STM32CubeIDE project, write the main application code that loads the TFLite model, processes input data, and invokes the model for inference.
